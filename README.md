## Data Structures
### Arrays
Arrays are contiguous blocks of memory used to store multiple elements of the same type. They provide constant-time access to elements via indexing.

### Linked Lists
Linked lists are linear data structures where elements are stored in nodes. Each node contains a data field and a reference (or pointer) to the next node in the sequence.

### Stacks
A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. Elements are inserted and removed from the same end, typically referred to as the top of the stack.

### Queues
A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle. Elements are inserted at the rear and removed from the front.

### Trees
Trees are hierarchical data structures consisting of nodes connected by edges. Each node has a parent and zero or more children. Common types include binary trees, binary search trees, and AVL trees.

### Graphs
Graphs consist of vertices (nodes) and edges (connections between nodes). They can be directed or undirected, weighted or unweighted. Graphs are used to model relationships between objects.

### Hash Tables
Hash tables (or hash maps) are data structures that store key-value pairs. They use a hash function to compute an index where an element can be stored or retrieved efficiently.

## Algorithms
### Searching Algorithms
Searching algorithms are used to find a particular element within a data structure. Common searching algorithms include linear search, binary search, and depth-first search (DFS), breadth-first search (BFS) for graphs.

### Sorting Algorithms
Sorting algorithms are used to rearrange elements in a specific order, such as numerical or lexicographical. Common sorting algorithms include bubble sort, insertion sort, merge sort, quick sort, and heap sort.

### Graph Algorithms
Graph algorithms operate on graphs to solve various problems. Examples include finding the shortest path (Dijkstra's algorithm), detecting cycles (Depth-First Search), and finding minimum spanning trees (Prim's algorithm, Kruskal's algorithm).

### Dynamic Programming
Dynamic programming is a method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems. It often involves solving each subproblem only once and storing the solutions to avoid redundant computations.

### Recursion
Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself to solve a problem. It is commonly used in algorithms involving trees, graphs, and divide-and-conquer strategies.
